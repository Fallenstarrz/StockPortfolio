# In this assignment you will build the first part of a stock portfolio manager.                                                                                                    #
# The manager program will consist of the following dictionaries:                                                                                                                   #
#    1. The first dictionary, called Names, maps the stock symbol to the company name (example: "GM" maps to "General Motors").                                                     #
#    2. The second dictionary, called Prices, maps the stock symbol to a list of 2 floating point numbers corresponding to the buy price (the price the user paid for the stock)    #
#       and the current market price (the price the user could sell the stock for today).                                                                                           #
#    3. The third dictionary, called Exposure, maps the stock symbol to a list of 2 floating point numbers, corresponding to the number of shares purchased,                        #
#       and the risk associated with holding onto the stock (i.e. How likely the stock is to gain value in the future).                                                             #
#       The risk associated with holding onto the stock should be a percentage                                                                                                      #
#       (the stock is high risk so the exposure value would be .5 or the stock is low risk so the exposure value would be .05)                                                      #
#                                                                                                                                                                                   #
# Your program should have the following functions:                                                                                                                                 #
#    1. addName - Asks the user for a Stock Symbol and Name pairing then adds it to the Names dictionary.                                                                           #
#    2. addPrices - Takes a Stock Symbol as an input parameter, then asks the user for the Buy price and the Current price of the corresponding stock,                              #
#                   adding them to the Prices dictionary.                                                                                                                           #
#    3. addExposure - Takes a Stock Symbol as an input parameter, then asks the user for the Risk and Shares of the corresponding stock,                                            #
#                    adding them to the Exposure dictionary.                                                                                                                        #
#    4. addStock - Calls addName, addPrices, and addExposure to add a new stock to the portfolio.                                                                                   #
#    5. main â€“ This should have no parameters but should create 2 stocks which means 2 entries in each dictionary with the key in each dictionary being the stock symbol.           #
#              Then, the program should display all the information for each stock.                                                                                                 #
#                                                                                                                                                                                   #
#    Be sure to use comments for both structure of the program and documentation of the code.                                                                                       #
#    All code must completely be your own individual work product.                                                                                                                  #
#                                                                                                                                                                                   #
